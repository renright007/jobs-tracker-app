# Cover Letter Preferences – Robert Enright

## ✅ Overall Style
- Written in a **human, conversational tone** — not overly polished or “AI-generated.”
- Reflects **my voice**, using natural phrasing I’d use in real speech or writing.
- Keeps things professional but **not overly formal**; I prefer directness over fluff.

## ✍️ Structure
1. **Opening paragraph**:  
   - Connect with the company personally or contextually.  
   - Highlight why I’m excited about the specific role or team.  
   - Avoid generic statements like “I’m writing to express…”

2. **Experience overview**:  
   - Summarize my background in a few key points.  
   - Focus on what I’ve built or improved — real impact.  
   - Keep industry references real and grounded (no buzzwords like “synergy” or “innovation culture”).

3. **Role fit**:  
   - Explain why the role aligns with what I enjoy doing.  
   - Mention tools and skills **only if relevant** and **in context**.  
   - Highlight the parts of the company culture or mission that resonate with me.

4. **Team contribution**:  
   - Speak to how I work with people: cross-functional, mentoring, collaborative tone.
   - Emphasize values like clarity, trust, autonomy.

5. **Closing**:  
   - End with something sincere and confident.  
   - Avoid robotic closings like “I look forward to hearing from you.”

## 🧠 Writing Style
- Prefer **em dashes** (—) or commas for natural rhythm; avoid semicolons.
- Limit adjectives; **show, don’t tell**.
- Avoid repetition of phrases like “I am confident that…” or “I believe that…”
- Use **my real work language**: tools, context, and contributions in plain English.
- Make room for **personality** — a small anecdote, a cultural detail, or a tone shift is good.

## 🚫 Avoid
- Over-polished “AI voice”
- Corporate speak or resume copy/paste
- Excessive keyword stuffing
- Passive language (e.g. “was given the opportunity…”)

## ✅ Target Length
- 4–6 short paragraphs
- No more than ~350–400 words
