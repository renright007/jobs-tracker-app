# Cover Letter Preferences – Robert Enright

## ✅ Overall Style
- Written in a **human, conversational tone** — not overly polished or “AI-generated.”
- Reflects **my voice**, using natural phrasing I’d use in real speech or writing.
- Keeps things professional but **not overly formal**; I prefer directness over fluff.

## ✍️ Structure
1. **Opening paragraph**:  
   - Highlight why I’m excited about the specific role or team.  
   - Avoid generic statements like “I’m writing to express…”
   - Grab their attention but in a clever manner, but do not over sensationalize it. Avoid being cheesy.

2. **Experience overview**:  
   - Summarize my background in a few key points.  
   - Focus on what I’ve built or improved — real impact.  
   - Keep industry references real and grounded (no buzzwords like “synergy” or “innovation culture”).

3. **Role fit**:  
   - Explain why the role aligns with what I enjoy doing.  
   - Mention tools and skills **only if relevant** and **in context**.  
   - Highlight the parts of the company culture or mission that resonate with me.

4. **Team contribution**:  
   - Speak to how I work with people: cross-functional, mentoring, collaborative tone.
   - Emphasize values like clarity, trust, autonomy.

5. **Closing**:  
   - End with something sincere and confident.  
   - Avoid robotic closings like “I look forward to hearing from you." or "I am thrilled..."

## 🧠 Writing Style
- Prefer **em dashes** (—) or commas for natural rhythm; avoid semicolons.
- Limit adjectives; **show, don’t tell**.
- Avoid repetition of phrases like “I am confident that…” or “I believe that…”
- Use **my real work language**: tools, context, and contributions in plain English.
- Make room for **personality** — a small anecdote, a cultural detail, or a tone shift is good.

## 🚫 Avoid
- Over-polished “AI voice”
- Corporate speak or resume copy/paste
- Excessive keyword stuffing
- Passive language (e.g. “was given the opportunity…”)

## ✅ Include
- Convincing positive reasons for me being a good fit
- Passion for required hard and soft skills
- Cultural fit
- Ambition to be a part of a growing organizations

## ✅ Sample Cover Letter
Dear Alpaca Team,

I’ve always been fascinated by the power of technology to make financial markets more accessible. Alpaca’s mission to democratize investing and its commitment to fostering a vibrant open-source community immediately caught my attention. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to a company that is shaping the future of financial services.

Over the past decade, I’ve worked across sectors from investment banking to public health, focusing on turning complex data into actionable insights. At Pay Ready, I designed and implemented a knowledge-based AI agent that educated employees while generating performance insights. I also overhauled the Salesforce data infrastructure, creating a more robust path to our centralized Looker database. These projects reinforced my ability to combine technical expertise with business impact.
The Analytics Engineer role at Alpaca aligns perfectly with what I enjoy most – wrangling large datasets, transforming complex data in Python, building scalable pipelines, and delivering insights that drive decisions. I have extensive experience with SQL, process automation, Python scripting, and BI tools, and I am comfortable working with cloud platforms such as GCP. At CloudKitchens, I gained hands-on experience working with Trino to query and analyze large-scale datasets efficiently. 

I’m eager to contribute my expertise to Alpaca’s data ecosystem and open-source initiatives.
Collaboration is at the core of my approach. At CloudKitchens, I led the Strategy & Planning team, automating data pipelines and scaling operations globally while working closely with cross-functional stakeholders. I prioritize clear communication, trust, and mentorship, creating environments where teams can deliver their best work.

With both a technical background and a passion for financial markets, I am confident that my experience in data engineering, Python-based transformations, and scalable analytics would make me a strong contributor to Alpaca’s mission. I would welcome the opportunity to help advance your vision of accessible, transparent investing.

Best regards,

Robert Enright
