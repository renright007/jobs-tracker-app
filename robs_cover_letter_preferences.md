# Cover Letter Preferences – Robert Enright

## ✅ Overall Style
- Written in a **human, conversational tone** — not overly polished or “AI-generated.”
- Reflects **my voice**, using natural phrasing I’d use in real speech or writing.
- Keeps things professional but **not overly formal**; I prefer directness over fluff.

## ✍️ Structure
1. **Opening paragraph**:  
   - Highlight why I’m excited about the specific role or team.  
   - Avoid generic statements like “I’m writing to express…”
   - Grab their attention but in a clever manner, but do not over sensationalize it. Avoid being cheesy.

2. **Experience overview**:  
   - Summarize my background in a few key points.  
   - Focus on what I’ve built or improved — real impact.  
   - Keep industry references real and grounded (no buzzwords like “synergy” or “innovation culture”).

3. **Role fit**:  
   - Explain why the role aligns with what I enjoy doing.  
   - Mention tools and skills **only if relevant** and **in context**.  
   - Highlight the parts of the company culture or mission that resonate with me.

4. **Team contribution**:  
   - Speak to how I work with people: cross-functional, mentoring, collaborative tone.
   - Emphasize values like clarity, trust, autonomy.

5. **Closing**:  
   - End with something sincere and confident.  
   - Avoid robotic closings like “I look forward to hearing from you." or "I am thrilled..."

## 🧠 Writing Style
- Prefer **em dashes** (—) or commas for natural rhythm; avoid semicolons.
- Limit adjectives; **show, don’t tell**.
- Avoid repetition of phrases like “I am confident that…” or “I believe that…”
- Use **my real work language**: tools, context, and contributions in plain English.
- Make room for **personality** — a small anecdote, a cultural detail, or a tone shift is good.

## 🚫 Avoid
- Over-polished “AI voice”
- Corporate speak or resume copy/paste
- Excessive keyword stuffing
- Passive language (e.g. “was given the opportunity…”)

## ✅ Include
- Convincing positive reasons for me being a good fit
- Passion for required hard and soft skills
- Cultural fit
- Ambition to be a part of a growing organizations

## ✅ Sample Cover Letter
Dear Zilch Team,
Zilch stands out because it isn’t just another payments product. Blending debit, credit, and savings into a single, flexible experience feels genuinely different, and it’s the kind of problem I like working on. Fast-moving, high-ownership environments suit me well, which is why the Senior Data Analyst role caught my attention.
I’ve spent the last decade working across investment banking, public sector, and product-led tech companies, always focused on turning messy data into decisions people can actually act on. At Pay Ready, I built a knowledge-based AI agent that surfaced operational insights and reduced internal friction, and I rebuilt our Salesforce data flows to create a reliable path into Looker. The common thread has been using data to improve how products work and how teams make decisions.
This role aligns closely with how I already work. I’m comfortable working with large datasets, analysing customer behaviour, and building models that support growth. SQL, Python, and dbt are core parts of my day-to-day, and I enjoy building self-serve tools that help teams answer their own questions without hand-holding.
I also care a lot about how teams operate. At CloudKitchens, I helped lead the Strategy & Planning function, automating pipelines and scaling analytics across global teams. Clear communication, trust, and good mentorship mattered just as much as the technical work, and that’s how I try to show up day to day.
I’d love the chance to talk about how I could contribute to Zilch’s product, support smarter decision-making, and help customers manage their money better.
Best,
Robert Enright
